## Churn-Analysis
# Introduction:
This repository provides an overview of the Churn Analysis project conducted using Python. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services or products. Analyzing customer churn is essential for businesses to understand and mitigate customer attrition.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project is related to a Telecom Industry.

# Content:
Dataset, EDA Notebook and Powerpoint Presentation.

# Project Overview
In this project, we analyze customer churn data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to churn. Python is used for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to gain insights 
 related to factors leading to customer churn and provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn rates.

# To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

Python (3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
Scikit-Learn (for machine learning)
[Optional] Other libraries based on the analysis requirements.

# Analysis
The analysis involves the following steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data's characteristics, exploring relationships between variables by performing both Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, and identifying potential patterns.
Interpretation: Interpreting the analysis's results and identifying key factors contributing to churn.

# Results
The results of the analysis will include:
Visualizations illustrating key findings from the EDA.
Insights into factors influencing customer churn.
Recommendations for reducing churn rates.
